            <li>First up you need to infuse the milk for the béchamel, in a medium saucepan add the soy/oat milk followed by the onion, bay, nutmeg & seasonings. Place the saucepan over a low heat & stir every now and then.</li>
            <li>For the ragu, in a large saucepan placed over a medium heat, add the oil followed by the onion, garlic, celery & a pinch of salt. Sweat the mix down for around 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the courgette, aubergine & mixed herbs. Turn the heat down lower, pop a lid on & allow the mix to cook for 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the vegan mince & stir well. Cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Deglaze the pan with the balsamic vinegar & chopped tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato puree, then pop the lid on and let the mix cook over a low heat for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>For the béchamel, in a saucepan add the vegan margarine and place the pan over a low heat.</li>
            <li>When the margarine is melted, add the flour. Using a spatular mix well. Cook the mix whilst stirring for a couple of minutes to cook out the flour. It should resemble a paste like consistency.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in the infused milk, a little at a time.</li>
            <li>Once you'd added all the milk, the béchamel should be creamy, if you want to make it cheesy, add vegan cheese & nutritional yeast.</li>
            <li>Build your lasagne in your oven proof baking dish, a layer at a time, I like to do ragu, béchamel then pasta sheets. Repeat this until you have filled your dish. Making sure the top layer is béchamel.</li>
            <li>Bake the lasagne in your oven for 45 minutes. Then serve.</li>
